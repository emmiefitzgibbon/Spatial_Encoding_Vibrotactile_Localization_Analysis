10/9/2025 15:50:11,P001,Discrete Constant,1,5,1,2,6,5,3,4,7,5,I preferred the other condition,"It was hard to tell how far away an object was because all the vibrations were constant (not getting stronger the closer I got) so I had to triangulate the object a lot, and it was particularly confusing when I was directly on top of the object, and so the haptic signals were changing all the time. I think with more time I could get the hang of it, but it was not very intuitive and pretty challenging."
10/9/2025 15:55:33,P001,Interpolated Constant,2,6,6,2,3,6,7,5,5,4,I preferred this condition,"I don't know if it is because I had some practice with the other condition, but this one overall felt easier, because I could tell exactly when I was pointing at the object, and when I wasn't, and I didn't have to triangulate the position. However, what was difficult about this was that because I felt like I could sense where the object was, when I went to hit it and the object wasn't there, I got more confused than in the first condition (usually this meant the object was right on top of me, but it was a lot of blind searching around where I thought the object was). 

Also, near the end of the experience, I felt as if my hands couldn't feel the front, and inside vibrations anymore, and I was judging based off of the other vibrations to sense where the object was. So that made it more difficult. "

I felt like the vibrations  in my fingers felt stronger than the vibrations in my hand. Overall it was a joyful experience and the system was very accurate. I could easily find the targets overall. Both 2 trials were pretty easy but I felt like moving around gave me more options to find the object easily compared to the trial which I was standing. When I  was standing, I could find where the target was, it was hard to estimate how far it was from me. It was hard for me to estimate the length between me and the target."
10/13/2025 15:57:07,P003,Discrete Graded,2,2,7,3,4,7,2,7,7,7,I preferred the other condition,It was hard to estimate how far the object was from me compared to the 1st experiment. It was easy to find where the targrt itself was but  it was hard to estimate how far it was from me.
10/16/2025 16:01:09,P004,Discrete Graded,1,5,4,2,7,4,4,1,7,3,I preferred this condition,I think I started getting frustrated in the second condition and that affected how much I wanted to work with it.
10/16/2025 16:06:23,P004,Interpolated Graded,2,1,2,1,7,2,3,1,3,2,I preferred the other condition,"During this condition, I sort of hit my limit of wanting to work with the haptics and interpret the feedback. In both conditions, I felt like I needed to triangulate the haptic feedback. The window of vibration felt very wide for each orb and I could not differentiate from very-close to sorta-close proximity. This condition was especially difficult because, at several points, the haptics were vibrating so much, my hands felt desensitized and I couldn't sense direction."
