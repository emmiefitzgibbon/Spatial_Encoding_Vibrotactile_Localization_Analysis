By the second attempts I certainly was focusing less on the individual feedback sources to guide me, and more the overall sensation of my hands. I could use this to very slightly perceive a heatmap of the location, and this was best done by ""panning"" the area back and forth with hands distant from each other, two heatmaps by which the location is triangulated. The rate of increase in comfort with this new sense felt slow."

Right at the target did at times seem to be a strong locus of energy that could perhaps be interpreted as that sphere? Also, any focus on the vibration was mostly relegated to the ""forward"" pointer finger, and all the others melted into the background as textural detail. I noticed my own improvement in intuiting the location. Interestingly on the second go I found more success keeping my hands together instead of triangulating with them apart. Left hand consistently felt stronger, as a technical note."
