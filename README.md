## Experiment 1: Main Study
- Experiment 1 compared distance based intensity grading and directional interpolation in a 2 x 2 mixed between and within subjects design. 
- Data is separated into separate folders for each condition, which each contain subfolders for each task.
- Trajectory folders were excluded from this dataset to reduce file size.

**File Naming Convention:**
- Locate task: `locate_P###_[condition]_MainStudy.csv`
- Pointing task: `pointing_accuracy_P###_[condition]_MainStudy.csv`
- Where `P###` is the participant ID (e.g., P001, P002)

## Experiment 2: Longitudinal Study
- Experiment 2 compared Discrete Graded and Interpolated Graded in between subjects design over two sessions
- Participants completed 3 blocks per session (6 blocks total).
- Only participants who completed both sessions are included in this dataset.
- Data is seperated into folders by Condition, then block number (1-6), then Locate and Point tasks
- Trajectory folders were excluded from this datasets to reduce file size.
- The questionnaire only includes responses from participants who completed both sessions 

**File Naming Convention:**
- Locate task: `locate_LP###_s[1-2]b[1-3]_[condition]_LongitudinalStudy_S[1-2]_B[1-3].csv`
- Pointing task: `pointing_accuracy_LP###_s[1-2]b[1-3]_[condition]_LongitudinalStudy_S[1-2]_B[1-3].csv`
- Where `LP###` is the participant ID (e.g., LP001, LP002) and `S[1-2]_B[1-3]` indicates session and block
